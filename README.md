# Brain-Cancer-Detection-with-Machine-Learning

Domain : Biostatistics and Data Science in Bioengineering

Libraries used:pandas,numpy,matplotlib,seaborn,sklearn

Implementation :The project deals with analysis of a set of protein levels obtained
from various meningioma patients. Meningioma or brain cancer are basically of three kinds:
Groups I, Group II and Group III, out of which Group I is more benign and the other two are
more lethal. The aim of this project is to identify the set of proteins which can act as a
potential biomarker based on their differential expression in various patient groups.
